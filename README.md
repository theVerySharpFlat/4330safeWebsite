# 4330safeWebsite

Requires:
    1. That you are on a rpi (may be slightly optional)
    2. That you have internet access
    3. That you have lighttpd installed (sudo apt install lighttpd)

This is the prototype website for 4330's safe. This may be ported to ionic, as it functions better as a mobil app, but since we are crunched for time, we are just going to keep it as a locally hosted website that runs on the raspberry pi. This may change after March 6th.

Also, you may want to create a copy of your lighttpd.conf file so that if you/I screw something up, you don't have to reinstall lighttpd(which I have done many times)
